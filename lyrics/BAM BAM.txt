"Bam Bam" lyrics
Camila Cabello Lyrics
"Bam Bam"
(feat. Ed Sheeran)

You said you hated the ocean, but you're surfin' now
I said I'd love you for life, but I just sold our house
We were kids at the start, I guess we're grown-ups now (Mmm)
Couldn't ever imagine even havin' doubts
But not everything works out, no
Now I'm out dancin' with strangers
You could be casually datin'
Damn, it's all changin' so fast
Así es la vida, sí
Yeah, that's just life, baby
Yeah, love came around
And it knocked me down
But I'm back on my feet
Así es la vida, sí
Yeah, that's just life, baby
I was barely standin'
But now I'm dancin'
He's all over me
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam (Así es la vida)
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam (Uh-huh)
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam (Eh, eh, uh-huh)
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam (Uh-huh)
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam
It's been a hell of a year, thank God we made it out
Yeah we were riding a wave, and trying not to drown
And on the surface I held it together
But underneath, I sorta came unwound
Where would I be? You're all that I need
My world, baby, you hold me down
You always hold me down, now
I've been the breaker and broken
Every mistake turned to moments
Wouldn't take anything back
Así es la vida, sí (Así es)
Yeah, that's just life, baby
Yeah, love came around
And it knocked me down
But I'm back on my feet
Así es la vida, sí
Yeah, that's just life, baby
I was barely standin'
But now I'm dancin'
She's all over me (He's all over me)
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam (Ahí, ahí)
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam (Pónganle azúcar, mi gente!)
Sigue bailando, hey
Sigue bailando (Keep dancing, yeah)
Sigue bailando (Keep dancing, yeah)
Sigue bailando
(Hay amor en todos lados) Sigue bailando
(Sigue, sigue, sigue bailando) Sigue bailando
(Hay amor en todos lados) Sigue bailando, woh
(Sigue, sigue, sigue bailando)
Así es la vida, sí
Yeah, that's just life, baby
Yeah, love came around
And it knocked me down
But I'm back on my feet
Así es la vida, sí
Yeah, that's just life, baby
I was barely standin'
But now I'm dancin'
She's all over me (He's all over me) (Hey! Hey!)
Now I'm, Now I'm dancin' (Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam)
Keep dancing, yeah
Now I'm, Now I'm dancin' (Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam)
Keep dancing, yeah
Now I'm, Now I'm dancin' (Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam)
