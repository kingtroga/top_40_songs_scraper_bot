"Fancy Like" lyrics
Walker Hayes Lyrics
"Fancy Like"

Ay
My girl is bangin'
She's so low maintenance
Don't need no champagne poppin' entertainment
Take her to Wendy's
Can't keep her off me
She wanna dip me like them fries in her Frosty
But every now and then when I get paid
I gotta spoil my baby with an upgrade (ay)
Ay, ay, ay
Yeah, we fancy like Applebee's on a date night
Got that Bourbon Street steak with the Oreo shake
Get some whipped cream on the top too
Two straws, one check, girl, I got you
Bougie like Natty in the Styrofoam
Squeak-squeakin' in the truck bed all the way home
Some Alabama-jamma, she my Dixieland delight
Ay, that's how we do, how we do, fancy like, oh
(Fancy like oh)
(Fancy like oh)
Fancy like oh
Uh, don't need no Tesla to impress her
My girl is happy rollin' on a Vespa (There she go)
Don't need no mansion (ooh) to get romancin' (No mansion, woo)
She's super fine, double wide, slow dancin' (Slow dancin')
But every now and then when I get paid
I gotta spoil my baby with an upgrade
Ay, ay, ay
Yeah, we fancy like Applebee's on a date night (That's right)
Got that Bourbon Street steak with the Oreo shake (Ay)
Get some whipped cream on the top too (Gotta add that whipped cream)
Two straws, one check, girl, I got you (Girl, I got you)
Bougie like Natty in the Styrofoam (Styrofoam)
Squeak-squeakin' in the truck bed all the way home (All the way home)
Some Alabama-jamma, she my Dixieland delight
Ay, that's how we do, how we do, fancy like
