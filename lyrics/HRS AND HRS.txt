"Hrs And Hrs" lyrics
Muni Long x August Alsina Lyrics
"Hrs And Hrs"

Yeah
I don't usually do this but, um
Can I sing to you?
Yeah, yeah
Yours, mine, ours
I could do this for hours
Sit and talk to you for hours
I wanna give you your flowers
And some champagne showers
Order shrimp and lobster towers
But it's me that gets devoured
Ooh
When you do what you do, I'm empowered
You give me a super power
Together the world could be ours
You sit me up on the counter
Instantly, it's thundershowers
Storming for a couple hours
When we finish, take a shower
I could do this for hours
And hours, and hours
I could do this for hours
And hours, and hours
