"INDUSTRY BABY" lyrics
Lil Nas X Lyrics
"INDUSTRY BABY"
(feat. Jack Harlow)

D-D-Daytrip took it to ten, hey
[Lil Nas X:]
Baby back, aye
Couple racks, aye
Couple Grammys on him
Couple plaques, aye
That's a fact, aye
Throw it back, aye
Throw it back, aye
And this one is for the champions
I ain't lost since I began, yuh
Funny how you said it was the end, yuh
Then I went did it again, yuh
I told you long ago, on the road
I got what they're waitin' for
I don't run from nothin', dog
Get your soldiers, tell 'em I ain't layin' low
You was never really rootin' for me anyway
When I'm back up at the top I wanna hear you say
"He don't run from nothin', dog"
Get your soldiers, tell 'em that the break is over
Uh, need to
Uh, need to get this album done
Need a couple number ones
Need a plaque on every song
Need me like one with Nicki now
Tell a rap nigga, "I don't see ya", ha
I'ma pop nigga like Bieber, ha
I don't fuck bitches, I'm queer, ha
But these niggas bitches like Madea
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ay, oh let's do it
I ain't fall off, I just ain't release my new shit
I blew up now everybody tryna sue me
You call me Nas, but the hood call me Doobie, yah
And this one is for the champions
I ain't lost since I began, yuh
Funny how you said it was the end, yuh
Then I went did it again, yuh
I told you long ago, on the road
I got what they're waitin' for (I got what they're waitin' for)
I don't run from nothin', dog
Get your soldiers, tell 'em I ain't layin' low
(Bitch, I ain't runnin' from no one)
You was never really rootin' for me anyway (Ooh, ooh)
When I'm back up at the top I wanna hear you say (Ooh, ooh)
"He don't run from nothin', dog"
Get your soldiers, tell 'em that the break is over (yeah)
[Jack Harlow:]
My track record so clean
They couldn't wait to just bash me
I must be gettin' too flashy
Y'all shouldn't let the world gas me (woo)
It's too late 'cause I'm here to stay and these girls know that I'm nasty
I sent her back to her boyfriend with my handprint on her ass cheek
City talkin', we takin' notes
Tell 'em all to keep makin' posts
Wish he could but he can't get close
OG so proud of me that he chokin' up while he makin' toasts
I'm the type that you can't control
Said I would then I made it so
I don't clear up rumors (aye)
Where's y'all sense of humor? (aye)
I'm done makin' jokes 'cause they got old like baby boomers
Turn my haters to consumers
I make vets feel like they're juniors (juniors)
Say your time is comin' soon but just like Oklahoma
Mine is comin' sooner
I'm just a late bloomer
I didn't peak in high school, I'm still out here gettin' cuter (woo)
All these social networks and computers
Got these pussies walkin' 'round like they ain't losers
[Lil Nas X:]
I told you long ago, on the road
I got what they're waitin' for (I got what they're waitin' for)
I don't run from nothin', dog
Get your soldiers, tell 'em I ain't layin' low
(Bitch, I ain't runnin' from no one)
You was never really rootin' for me anyway
When I'm back up at the top I wanna hear you say
"He don't run from nothin', dog"
Get your soldiers, tell 'em that the break is over
Yeah
I'm the industry baby
