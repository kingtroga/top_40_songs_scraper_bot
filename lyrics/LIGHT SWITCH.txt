"Light Switch" lyrics
Charlie Puth Lyrics
"Light Switch"

Yeah
Why you callin' at 11:30
When you only wanna do me dirty?
But I hit right back
'Cause you got that-that, yeah
Why you always wanna act like lovers?
But you never wanna be each others'
I say, "Don't look back"
But I go right back and
All the sudden, I'm hypnotized
You're the one that I can't deny
Every time that I say I'm gonna walk away
You turn me on like a light switch
When you're movin' your body around and around
Now, I don't wanna fight this (No)
You know how to just make me want
You turn me on like a light switch
When you're movin' your body around and around
You got me in a tight grip (Yeah)
You know how to just make me want you, baby
Do you love it when you keep me guessin' (Me guessin')
When you're leaving then you leave me stressin'? (Me stressin')
But I can't stay mad when you walk like that, no
Why you always wanna act like lovers?
But you never wanna be each others'
I say, "Don't look back"
But I go right back and
All the sudden, I'm hypnotized (Hypnotized)
You're the one that I can't deny (Can't deny)
Every time that I say I'm gonna walk away (Yeah)
You turn me on like a light switch
When you're movin' your body around and around
Now, I don't wanna fight this (No)
