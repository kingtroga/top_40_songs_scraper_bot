"Need To Know"

Yeah
Wanna know what it's like (Like)
Baby, show me what it's like (Like)
I don't really got no type (Type)
I just wanna fuck all night
Yeah-yeah, oh-whoa-whoa (Oh, ooh, mm)
Baby, I need to know, mm (Yeah, need to know)
I just been fantasizin' (Size)
And we got a lotta time (Time)
Baby, come throw the pipe (Pipe)
Gotta know what it's like (Like)
Yeah-yeah, oh-whoa-whoa
Baby, I need to know, mm
What's your size? (Size)
Add, subtract, divide ('Vide)
Daddy don't throw no curves (Curves)
Hold up, I'm goin' wide (Wide)
We could just start at ten (Ten)
Then we can go to five (Five)
I don't play with my pen (Pen)
I mean what I write
Yeah-yeah, whoa-whoa-whoa
I just can't help but be sexual (Oh)
Tell me your schedule (Yeah)
I got a lotta new tricks for you, baby
Just sayin' I'm flexible (I will)
I do what I can to get you off (I will)
Might just fuck him with my makeup on (I will)
Eat it like I need an apron on (You okay?)
Eat it 'til I need to change my thong (You okay?)
We could do it to your favorite song (You okay?)
Take a ride into the danger zone
You know my nigga be buggin' me
I just be wonderin' if you can fuck on me better
Itchin' for me like an ugly sweater
Need it in me like a Chuck E. need cheddar
I need to know
Wanna know what it's like (Like)
Baby, show me what it's like (Like)
I don't really got no type (Type)
I just wanna fuck all night
Yeah-yeah, oh-whoa-whoa (Oh, ooh, mm)
Baby, I need to know, mm (Yeah, need to know)
I just been fantasizin' (Size)
And we got a lotta time (Time)
Baby, come throw the pipe (Pipe)
Gotta know what it's like (Like)
Yeah-yeah, oh-whoa-whoa
Baby, I need to know, mm
You're exciting, boy, come find me
Your eyes told me, "Girl, come ride me"
Fuck that feeling both us fighting
Could he try me? (Yeah) Mm, most likely
Tryna see if you could handle this ass
Prolly give his ass a panic attack
Sorry if I gave a random erection
Prolly thinkin' I'm a telekinetic
Oh, wait, you a fan of the magic?
Poof, pussy like an Alakazam
I heard from a friend of a friend
That that dick was a ten out of ten
I can't stand it, just one night me
Clink with the drink, gimme a sip
Tell me what's your kink, gimme the dick
Spank me, slap me, choke me, bite me (Ew)
Oh, wait, I can take it (Ah)
Give a fuck 'bout what your wifey's sayin' (Yeah)
Wanna know what it's like (Like)
Baby, show me what it's like (Like)
I don't really got no type (Type)
I just wanna fuck all night
Yeah-yeah, oh-whoa-whoa (Oh, ooh, mm)
Baby, I need to know, mm (Yeah, need to know)
I just been fantasizin' (Size)
And we got a lotta time (Time)
Baby, come throw the pipe (Pipe)
Gotta know what it's like (Like)
