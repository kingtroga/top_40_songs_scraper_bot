Summer Walker Lyrics
"No Love (Extended Version)"
(feat. SZA & Cardi B)

Oh, ooh woah
Oh-oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Here I am, there you are fallin' out of love again
I don't know just how to feel
It's time to meet you where you are
I needed some time apart
'Cause you've been playin', I've been loyal
No questions, boy, I've been ten toes down
To communications with niggas that wanna be around
So I found it crazy how bitches that's in my mentions now
Nothin' that you're sayin' add up to me, how I'm feelin' now
I just wanna be everything you need
I wish you could see how you hurtin' me
II-I-I got no more love, this time I'm done with that (Done with you)
I'm thinkin' of ways that I can hurt you back
If I had you back (Back)
I wouldn't've did all that (That)
I would've played it just how you wanted to play it
You didn't yet see my worth, so you try to play me
But I was so in love, love
That I just got a little bit too complicated
But if I had you back, all I wanna do is fuck (Fuck)
Get drunk (Get drunk), take drugs (Take drugs)
(Fuck love)
All I wanna do is fuck (Fuck)
Get drunk (Oh), hop planes
All lust, there will be no lovin' you
It would be no lovin' you
If I did it all again
I would give, like, ten percent
You deserve, like, half of that
I'ma need my money back
I'm ridin' through your hood, you pissed me off again
Finna let new niggas come find me
I've been trippin' like I don't got that designer pussy
All I'm tryna see is your credit card, swipe it all for me
Get me what I want, I don't need it
Just CC me, just VV me, just that dick when I call (Dick when I call)
No more feelings involved, I done seen all I need to
Funny how you say you 'bout us
You don't ever pull up on me, put it on me, get me right (Right)
You the one that ruined us, can't give no, can't give no
Fuck (Fuck)
Get drunk (Get drunk), take drugs (Take drugs)
(Fuck love)
All I wanna do is fuck (Fuck)
