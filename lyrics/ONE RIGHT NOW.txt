"One Right Now" lyrics
Post Malone & The Weeknd Lyrics
"One Right Now"

Na-na-na-na, na-na
Na-na-na-na, oh no
Yeah, yeah
Said you love me, but I don't care
That I broke my hand on the same wall
That you told me that he fucked you on (Oh)
You think it's so easy fuckin' with my feelings
I got one comin' over and one right now (Uh)
One right now
(One right now, one right now, oh)
I got one comin' over and one right now
Said you wanna have my babies
I fucked you so good, you should pay me
Don't call me "baby" when you did me so wrong
(When you did me so wrong)
But I got over what you did already
Body for a body, so petty
How many of your friends fit in my Rolls? (Can you fit in my Rolls?)
Bought you a new face, you should call me "Dad," baby
Herm√®s, but you dropped the bag, baby
Truth is, maybe one's just not enough
You say you love me, but I don't care
That I broke my hand on the same wall
That you told me that he fucked you on (That he fucked you on)
You think it's so easy fuckin' with my feelings (Feelings)
I got one comin' over and one right now (Uh)
One right now (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(One right now, one right now, oh yeah)
