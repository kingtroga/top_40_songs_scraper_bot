"Sand In My Boots" lyrics
Morgan Wallen Lyrics
"Sand In My Boots"

She asked me where I was from
I said somewhere you've never been to
Little town outside of Knoxville
Hidden by some dogwood trees
She tried talking with my accent
We held hands and waded into that blue water
She left her flip-flops by my Red Wings on the beach
Yeah, but now I'm dodging potholes
In my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heartbroke desperado
Headed right back to my roots
Something 'bout the way she kissed me
Tells me she'd love eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me
Was some sand in my boots
I said, "Let's go shoot tequila"
So we walked back to that beach bar
She said, "Don't cowboys drink whiskey?"
So we drank bottom shelf
She said, "Damn, that sky looks perfect"
I said, "Girl, you've never seen stars
Like the ones back home" and she said
"Maybe I should see 'em for myself"
Yeah, but now I'm dodging potholes
In my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heartbroke desperado
Headed right back to my roots
Something 'bout the way she kissed me
Tells me she'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me
Was some sand in my boots
I said, "Meet me in the morning"
And she told me I was crazy
Yeah, but I still thought that maybe she'd show up
Oh, but now I'm dodging potholes
In my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heartbroke desperado
Headed right back to my roots
Something 'bout the way she kissed me
Tells me she'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me
Was some sand in my boots
Yeah, but all I brought back with me
Was some sand in my boots
