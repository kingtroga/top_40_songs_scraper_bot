"'Til You Can't" lyrics
Cody Johnson Lyrics
"'Til You Can't"

You can tell your old man you'll do some largemouth fishing another time
You just got too much on your plate to bait and cast a line
You can always put a rain check in his hand till you can't
You can keep putting off forever with that girl who's heart you hold
Swearing that you'll ask some day further down the road
You can always put a diamond on her hand till you can't
If you got a chance, take it, take it while you got a chance
If you got a dream, chase it, 'cause a dream won't chase you back
If you're gonna love somebody, hold 'em as long and as strong and as close as you can
Till you can't
There's a box of greasy parts sitting in the trunk of that '65
Still waiting on you and your granddad to bring it back to life
You can always get around to fixing up that Pontiac till you can't
If you got a chance, take it, take it while you got a chance
If you got a dream, chase it, 'cause a dream won't chase you back
If you're gonna love somebody, hold 'em as long and as strong and as close as you can
Till you can't
So take that phone call from your momma and just talk away
'Cause you'll never know how bad you wanna till you can't someday
Don't wait on tomorrow 'cause tomorrow may not show
Say your sorries, your I-love-yous, 'cause man you never know
If you got a chance, take it, take it while you got a chance
If you got a dream, chase it, 'cause a dream won't chase you back
If you're gonna love somebody, hold 'em as long and as strong and as close as you can
Till you can't
If you got a chance, take it, take it while you got a chance
If you got a dream, chase it, 'cause a dream won't chase you back
If you're gonna love somebody, hold 'em as long and as strong and as close as you can
Until you can't
