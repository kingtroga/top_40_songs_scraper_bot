"We Don't Talk About Bruno" lyrics
Encanto Cast Lyrics
"We Don't Talk About Bruno"
(from "Encanto" soundtrack)
[Pepa:]
We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no
We don't talk about Bruno, but
It was my wedding day
[Félix:]
It was our wedding day
[Pepa:]
We were getting ready
And there wasn't a cloud in the sky
[Félix:]
No clouds allowed in the sky
[Pepa:]
Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin
[Félix:]
Thunder
[Pepa:]
You're telling the story or am I?
[Félix:]
I'm sorry, mi vida, go on
[Pepa:]
Bruno says, "It looks like rain"
[Félix:]
Why did he tell us?
[Pepa:]
In doing so, he floods my brain
[Félix:]
Abuela get the umbrellas
[Pepa:]
Married in a hurricane
[Félix:]
What a joyous day but anyway
[Pepa & Félix:]
We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no
We don't talk about Bruno
[Dolores:]
Hey, grew to live in fear of Bruno stuttering or stumbling
I can always hear him sort of muttering and mumbling
I associate him with the sound of falling sand, ch-ch-ch
It's a heavy lift with a gift so humbling
Always left Abuela and the family fumbling
Grappling with prophecies they couldn't understand
Do you understand?
[Camilo:]
Seven-foot frame, rats along his back
When he calls your name it all fades to black
Yeah, he sees your dreams and feasts on your screams (Hey)
[Pepa & Camilo:]
We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no
[Dolores:]
No, no
[Pepa & Camilo:]
We don't talk about Bruno
[Dolores:]
We don't talk about Bruno
[Townsperson 1:]
He told me my fish would die, the next day, dead
[Ensemble:]
No, no
[Townsperson 2:]
He told me I'd grow a gut and just like he said
[Ensemble:]
No, no
[Townsperson 3:]
He said that all my hair would disappear, now, look at my head
[Ensemble:]
Hey!
No, no
Your fate is sealed when your prophecy is read
[Isabela:]
He told me that the life of my dreams
Would be promised, and someday be mine
He told me that my power would grow
Like the grapes that thrive on the vine
[Abuela Alma:]
Óye, Mariano's on his way
[Dolores:]
He told me that the man of my dreams
Would be just out of reach
Betrothed to another
It's like I hear him, now
[Isabela:]
Hey sis, I want not a sound out of you
[Dolores:]
It's like I can hear him now, I can hear him now
[Mirabel:]
Um, Bruno
Yeah, about that Bruno
I really need to know about Bruno
Give me the truth and the whole truth, Bruno
[Camilo:]
Isabela, your boyfriend's here
[Abuela Alma & Isabela:]
Time for dinner
[Camilo:]
A seven-foot frame, rats along his back
[Pepa:]
It was my wedding day
[Félix:]
It was our wedding day
[Isabela:]
He told me that the life of my dreams
[Dolores:]
Grew to live in fear of Bruno stuttering or stumbling
[Camilo:]
When he calls your name it all fades to black
[Pepa:]
We were getting ready and there wasn't a cloud in the sky
[Félix:]
No clouds allowed in the sky
[Isabela:]
Would be promised and some day be mine
[Dolores:]
I can always hear him sort of muttering and mumbling
I associate him with the sound of falling sand, ch-ch-ch
[Camilo:]
Yeah, he sees your dreams
[Pepa:]
Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin
[Isabela:]
He told me that my power would grow
[Dolores:]
It's a heavy lift with a gift so humbling
[Camilo:]
And feasts on your screams
[Félix:]
Thunder
[Pepa:]
You're telling the story or am I?
[Félix:]
I'm sorry mi vida go on
[Isabela:]
Like the grapes that thrive on the vine, I'm fine
[Dolores:]
Always left Abuela and the family fumbling
Grappling with prophecies they couldn't understand
Do you understand
[Abuela Alma:]
Óye, Mariano's on his way
[Pepa:]
Bruno says, "It looks like rain"
[Félix:]
Why did he tell us?
[Camilo:]
Seven-foot frame, rats along his back
[Isabela:]
He told me that the life of my dreams would be promised and someday be mine
[Dolores:]
He told me that the man of my dreams would be just out of reach
[Pepa:]
In doing so, he floods my brain
[Félix:]
Abuela get the umbrellas
[Camilo:]
When he calls your name it all fades to black
[Dolores:]
Betrothed to another, another
[Camilo:]
Yeah, he sees your dreams and feasts on your screams
[Pepa:]
