"Right Now" lyrics
Lil Baby Lyrics
"Right Now"
(feat. Young Thug)
[Lil Baby:]
I can't wait around for nobody, I need it right now
I might buy that car if it make the right sound
Solitare ear ring bling from a mile away
I can't do what she want me to do, she tryna take my child away
I think my past tryna haunt me (haunt me)
What do everybody want from me?
What do everybody want from me?
What do everybody want from me? (from me)
I gotta give it to 'em, if I don't
I might go to the hood, I'll make a song
Turn the trap spot to the studio
I'm tryna make a way for my folks
Seein' how I'm Oakland City only hope
I gotta get it, I ain't got time to play
Ain't got no time to waste
I've been havin' nightmares about goin' back to jail, so I wake up
Drankin' all this lean, poppin' Adderall so I can stay up
Niggas that I used to love actin' like they're mad 'cause I got my cake up
Ain't gon' never let it get to a nigga, keep on grindin', gotta get another million
Condo on Peachtree, I paid the rent for the closet
They just wanna talk about my past, they don't wanna accept the fact that I'm a boss
Everything I wanted, I'ma go and get it, I ain't trippin' 'bout a cost, yeah
Everybody want a piece of the winnings, they're never there when you're lost
